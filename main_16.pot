msgid "When < UCI_LimitStrength > is enabled, the engine uses the < UCI_Elo > value"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:99
msgid "to adjust its playing strength. Engines use different algorithms to achieve this,"

#: main_16.cpp:101
msgid "such as reducing the search depth, limiting the number of positions examined,"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:103
msgid "or adding some randomness to the evaluation function."

#: main_16.cpp:105
msgid "The actual Elo rating achieved by the engine is often an estimate,"

#: main_16.cpp:109
msgid "You can use this feature to play an engine at a level comparable to your own"

#: main_16.cpp:121
msgid "The method that I have used is based on the code of Ryan Benitez"

#: main_16.cpp:123

#: main_16.cpp:139

msgid "decrease it to make the engine weaker."
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:143
msgid "There is also a < Variety > parameter that can be adjusted."
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:145
msgid "My intention for this option was that the engine would play a more varied game."
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:147
msgid "Then I realised that it could be combined with an < Allowed deficit > option"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:149
msgid "to adjust the engine playing strength further."
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:151
msgid "Lines that are weaker than the < Allowed deficit(centi-pawns) >"

#: main_16.cpp:153
msgid "when compared to the best move found, are excluded when a move is selected."
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:155
msgid "The move that will be played is chosen at random from the remaining moves."
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:157
msgid "So raising the value of < Variety > and < Allowed deficit > weakens the engine."
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:159
msgid "Therefore, if you want the engine to sometimes blunder a rook,"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:161
msgid "the upper limit of < Allowed deficit > should be set to 600"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:163
msgid "To occasionally blunder a knight or bishop, it should be set to 350"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:165
msgid "for a pawn it should be about 125."
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:167
msgid "You can use the < Variety > option just to vary the play if you set"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:169
msgid "the < Allowed deficit > to a low value, say 25 centi-pawns."
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:171
msgid "However, even this will still weaken the engine somewhat because the engine"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:173
msgid "will use the < MultiPV > method of searching, which is slower than normal."
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:175
msgid "< Moves to go > is the number of moves that the engine is required to play"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:177
msgid "in whatever time it has remaining.  So if it has 2 minutes, 40 seconds left"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:179
msgid "(160 seconds) and moves to go is set to 40 for that time period,"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:181
msgid "it will calculate the time available for its next move as \t160 / 40 = 4 seconds"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:183
msgid "and spend roughly that amount of time \ton its next move."
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:185
msgid "So the engine will play progressively faster as its time ticks away."
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:187
msgid "I have set different numbers for various time periods to even out the time usage."
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:189
msgid "Although I find it best to set a higher number for the last minute,"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:191
msgid "so that the engine does not lose on time."
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:193
msgid "Speeding up the engine, either by raising these < Moves to go > values,"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:195
msgid "or by reducing the overall time it has for the game, is another way"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:197
msgid "of weakening the engine."
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:199
msgid "With the Cyclone Xtreme engine, loading a random personality will also"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:201
msgid "usually weaken the engine."
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:203
msgid "Armed with all of these options, you should be able to adjust"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:205
msgid "all of these engines to a playing strength that suits you,"
msgstr ""

#: main_16.cpp:207
msgid "although it may take a fair amount of experimentation to achieve this."
